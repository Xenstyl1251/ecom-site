        F50 Speed and Lightweight Speed: The adidas F50 series in built for
        maximum speed and agility whilst offering a locked-in and comfortable
        feel. Everything about the new generation boot is built for explosive
        acceleration and controlling the ball while travelling at speed. The
        boots will be available in laced and laceless will be worn on pitch for

        Leao, Son Heung-min, Lamine Yamal and Florian Wirtz. The iconic adidas
        F50 returns to The World's Largest Bootroom at YPSoccer for the first
        time in 9 years. Re-designed to support the needs of the modern-day
        player.
